“I am a learner of the ALX [back end program] and I want to revamp my GitHub Profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search. This is why I started with software engineering, what I am passionate about and what inspires me: [is coding]. My aim is to [be a full stack developer] and that’s why I would like to work on [AI projects].Please prepare a template I can use, which revamps all the sections of the GitHub profile. Enrich this template with HTML markups and compelling format and make it professional. After finishing, please ask me how you can help me making this template more personalized.









# airbnb-clone-project
it's an airbnb clone project for ALX program

// we will learn too many concepts in this project such as Api's and back end technologies, as well as Django and Advanced Python and JS 

Airbnb Clone Project
Team Roles

Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. Implements APIs, manages authentication/authorization, and ensures business logic is correctly applied.

Frontend Developer
Focuses on designing and coding the client-side of the application, creating responsive UI/UX for users to interact with the platform.

Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the database, ensuring its design, security, performance, and availability. Responsible for backups, scaling, and tuning queries.

DevOps Engineer
Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines, manages cloud infrastructure, deployment processes, and system monitoring.

QA Engineer
Ensures the quality of the application through testing (manual and automated), identifying bugs, and verifying fixes.

Project Manager
Coordinates tasks across the team, manages timelines, and ensures deliverables meet project requirements.

Technology Stack

Django
A Python-based web framework used to build RESTful APIs and handle backend logic.

PostgreSQL
A relational database system used to store and manage structured data such as users, bookings, and payments.

GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data, improving efficiency and flexibility.

React (optional frontend)
A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.

Docker
Used for containerization, ensuring the application runs consistently across different environments.

GitHub Actions
A tool for automating workflows like testing and deploying through CI/CD pipelines.

Relationships:

A user can own multiple properties.

A property can have multiple bookings.

A booking belongs to one property and one user.

A user can leave multiple reviews, but each review is tied to one property.

A payment is associated with one booking.

Feature Breakdown

User Management
Handles user registration, login, authentication, and profile management. Provides role-based access (host vs. guest).

Property Management
Hosts can list, update, or remove properties. Includes property details like location, pricing, and availability.

Booking System
Guests can book properties, view reservations, and manage cancellations. Ensures availability tracking.

Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings on properties they’ve stayed in. Reviews help maintain trust in the platform.

Payment System
Securely processes guest payments for bookings, and ensures hosts are compensated.

API Security

Authentication
Ensures only registered users can access APIs. Commonly implemented with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Authorization
Restricts users to actions allowed by their role (e.g., only hosts can add properties).

Rate Limiting
Protects against abuse by limiting the number of API requests per user in a given timeframe.

Data Encryption
Protects sensitive user information (passwords, payment info) both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest.

Why Security Matters:

Protects user data from breaches.

Ensures safe financial transactions.

Maintains trust in the platform.

CI/CD Pipeline

What it is:
CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. It ensures rapid delivery of new features with minimal errors.

Tools we can use:

GitHub Actions → automate testing, linting, deployment.

Docker → containerize the app for consistent environments.

Kubernetes (optional) → orchestration for scaling services.electronically. It's a system for storing, managing, and retrieving information.





# SQL Joins Queries

This project demonstrates different types of SQL joins for the **alx-airbnb-database** project.

## Queries

### 1. INNER JOIN
Retrieves all bookings with the respective users who made those bookings.  
This only shows records where a booking has a matching user.

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Retrieves all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.  
This ensures all properties are displayed, even if no review exists for them.

### 3. FULL OUTER JOIN
Retrieves all users and all bookings, even if:
- A user has no booking.
- A booking is not linked to a user.
